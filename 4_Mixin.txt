-- Mixin is a reusable piece of code in scss. This allow us even more compact code.
e.g.,
	@mixin name {
  		property: value;
  		property: value;
  		...
	}

-- Once mixin is written, you can use anywhere and to use it we implement "@include" keyword
e.g.,
	selector {
  		@include mixin-name;
	}

-- Mixins can be used inside another mixin as well.
