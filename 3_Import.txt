-- import is scss allows us to include small scss file from outside.
e.g.,
	@import filename;

-- When importing other scss files, there is no need to write ".scss" part.
-- Usually when we make small scss file we name them partials like "_filename.scss".
-- This way compiler understand it's a partial and it doesn't need seprate css file.

-- These partials are usually imported into a root file and then that root file is compiled into final css.
