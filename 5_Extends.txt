-- Extend works pretty similar to include i.e. it allows to include another piece of css code into our current css.
-- @extend works with normal scss code not just mixins.
-- With @extend --> your code become more compact and dry.

e.g.,

	.button-basic  {
  		border: none;
  		padding: 15px 30px;

  		cursor: pointer;

  		@extend .button-basic;
  		background-color: red;
	}

	.button-submit  {
  		@extend .button-basic;
