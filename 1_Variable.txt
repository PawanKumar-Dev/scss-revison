-- In Sass we can have variables which can store stuff like color, sizes etc.
e.g. $variable = variable_value

-- These variable has global and local scope as well.
-- You can make local variable into global one by using "!global" keyword.
-- Try to define all your global keyword into _global.scss file. Considered best practise.
